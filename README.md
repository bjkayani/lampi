#Lampi - IoT Smart Lamp

This repo contains the code for my Lampi which is a connected smart lamp. The code is taken from the EECS 377 Connected Devices class but modified to work on a long term basis. It doesnt have any of the data analytics or security portion implemented in order to make further development easier. 

There are some things that I want to try to get working with my Lampi. 
-web based control
-google home voice control
-android app control
-weather display and corresponding lighting effect
-google calender display
