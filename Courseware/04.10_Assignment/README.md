# What to Turn in

At the completion of Assignment 4, you should have updated `lamp_service.py`, updated the Kivy app, `lamp_cmd`, added Supervisor configuration files, and two MQTT configuration files for bridging (one for each member of the pair).  Store a copy of all  configuration files in the repository under a directory "Lampi/config" as part of your Git Pull Request, with appropriate names..

You need to turn in the following:

1. A short (a few sentences) write up from each member of the pair summarizing what they learned completing the assignment, and one thing that surprised them (good, bad, or just surprising).  This should in **connected-devices/writeup.md** in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format.  You can find a template file in **connected-devices/template\_writeup.md**
2. A Git Pull Request
3. A short video demonstrating the required behaviors emailed to the instructor and TA.  The video should be named **[assignment 3]_[LAST_NAME_1]\_[LAST_NAME_2].[video format]**.  So, for this assignment, if your pair's last names are "Smith" and "Jones" and you record a .MOV, you would email a file named ```2_smith_jones.mov``` to the instructor.
4. A live demo at the beginning of the next class - **be prepared!**

Notes:

* All Python code should be formatted to conform to PEP8 standards. See [PEP8 documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) for more info.
* the video should demonstrate::
    * change notifications appearing in an SSH session on EC2 from *both* lamps caused by the Kivy UIs
    * sending lamp configurations to both lamps from an SSH session on EC2 (send a different configuration to each lamp for clarity)
